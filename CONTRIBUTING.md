## Add or update a skill

1. Follow authoring guidance on [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
2. Depending on whether it's a pipeline or a guidance skill, start with the appropriate template in `templates/`.
3. Put the skill at `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
4. Folder name must match frontmatter `name`. Set `category` and `summary` (the public table blurb). Check format with `test_skill_quality.py`
5. Run `python docs/hooks/skill_catalog.py` to refresh the skill table in `README.md` and `docs/index.html`. Do not edit `tests/test_skill_catalog.py` — it discovers `skills/*/SKILL.md` itself.
6. Open a PR and request a second-party review.

## Test

Several levels of testing is advised.

#### 1. Repo-level tests: formatting
* ./tests/test_skill_quality.py tests skill's formatting
* ./tests/test_sync_bundle.py tests that unnecessary skill folders are not synced to Unity Catalog/Gateway

Both these tests can be invoked on all skills with 
```
uv run --isolated --with pytest --with pyyaml python -m pytest -q tests
```

#### 2.Skill-level unit tests
Store your skill's unit tests here `./skills/<your_skill>/tests`
```
uv run --isolated --with pytest --with-requirements skills/<name>/tests/requirements.txt \
    python -m pytest -q skills/<name>/tests
```

#### Automated CI
Both overall formatting and unit tests can be automated with CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) which runs on every non-draft PR. The repo tests also check that README.md and `docs/index.html` match the skills; if they lag, the job fails and prints the regenerate command.
- Put a skill's test-only dependencies in `skills/<name>/tests/requirements.txt`, pinned to versions you ran. CI finds every `skills/*/tests/` folder automatically.
- A skill's `eval/` or `tests/` folder is never published by `sync_skills_git2unity.py`; `tests/test_sync_bundle.py` fails if that filter is removed.
- CI also scans the full git history for secrets with gitleaks.

#### 3. Evaluate with and without skill
<!-- Do not change this header which generates evaluation.md -->

A skill should make the agent measurably better at its task. Each skill is benchmarked on 3-5 tasks by running Genie Code twice per task, once with the skill and once without, and scoring both runs the same way.

The [skill-eval](skills/skill-eval/SKILL.md) skill builds the harness for this. Scores are logged to an MLflow experiment, and a paired comparison report `eval_report.md` is written to the skill's `eval/` folder. The [skill catalog](https://databricks-industry-solutions.github.io/vital-skills/guide/skills/) shows which skills have a report.

##### Run an evaluation

1. Ask Genie Code to use the skill-eval skill to generate an evaluation harness for your skill.
2. Have Genie Code generate a notebook for each task, once with your skill and once without it.
3. Use the skill-eval harness to score both notebooks. This logs the scores to MLflow and writes `eval_report.md`.

##### What the `eval/` folder holds

```text
skills/<skill-name>/eval/
├── README.md               # run protocol, scorer summary, ship gate
├── evalset.json            # 3-5 benchmark task definitions (task_id, dataset, query)
├── expectations.json       # difficulty, expectations, deterministic checks per task
├── generate_data.py        # synthetic data generator (seeds the volume)
├── scorers.py              # deterministic + LLM judge definitions
├── score_<skill>.py        # generated scoring notebook: evaluate, compare, report
├── eval_report.md          # after running: paired comparison + failure taxonomy
├── baseline_scores.json    # after running: skill-off per-task scores
└── with_skill_scores.json  # after running: skill-on per-task scores
```

> [!WARNING]
> **The `eval/` folder holds the answer key.** `expectations.json` contains the expected results, so `eval/` is excluded from the bundle that is synced to Unity Catalog. Do not copy it into a skill's `references/`.

## Docs site

Most of the [docs site](https://databricks-industry-solutions.github.io/vital-skills/) is generated from `SKILL.md` files, `README.md`, and this file. Edit those, not the pages in `docs/`.

> [!WARNING]
> Some headings in `README.md` and this file are copied to the site by name. Read [DOCS.md](DOCS.md) before renaming or re-leveling a heading, and for how to preview and publish the site.
